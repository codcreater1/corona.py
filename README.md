This Python script draws a colorful spiral pattern using the Turtle module. As the spiral progresses, both the forward distance and the angle of rotation increase incrementally, creating an engaging visual effect.
Customize
You can modify the script to change the colors, background color, speed, initial position, or any other parameters to create different visual effects.
Experiment with different values for the forward distance (a) and the angle of rotation (b) to create unique spiral patterns.
